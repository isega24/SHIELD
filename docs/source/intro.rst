Introduction
=================================

SHIELD (Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics) is a regularization 
technique that approach aims not only to enhance model interpretability but also to 
directly contribute to overall model quality by enhancing the relationship between 
data and model quality. Specifically, SHIELD adds a regularization term to the
objective function of a model that penalizes the model if it relies too heavily on
a small subset of input features.


SHIELD is a regularization technique that can be used with any model that can be trained
using gradient descent. It is implemented in Python and is available as a package that
can be installed with this repo.
