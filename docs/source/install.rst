Installation
=================================

To use and test SHIELD, we preinstalled the REVEL framework, so you will need to install it first:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/isega24/ReVel.git
    pip install ./ReVel

Then, you can install SHIELD by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/isega24/SHIELD.git
    pip install ./SHIELD
